# The Coder's Computer Reflection and Discussion

What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
  *Code completion - allows you to start typing, then the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you type. Also includes closing of tags, brackets, and quotation marks to help ensure writing is always in code. Some text editors include a feature called Emmet that is shorthand language that speeds up code writing.
  *Syntax Highlighting - is a feature that takes typed text and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text.
  *Variety of Themes/Extensions - themes help customize backgrounds and text. Its good to find a text editor with themes that help reduce eye strain & fatigue. You want to get a text editor that can grow with you as your needs grow. A text editor that has a good selection of extensions will help you have the ability to add functionality as needed.

What do the following commands do?
 -pwd: Print Working Directory (you are here demand)
  -ls: List Contents of a Directory
  -cd: Change Directory
  -mkdir: used to Create a new Directory
  -touch: used to create, change and modify the timestamps of a file

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
*cd projects - Changing directory to the file or folder called projects
*mkdir new-project - creates a new directory called new project that is already within a directory
*touch new-project/newfile.md - update the time stamps from file new-project and newfile.md  
*cd .. - specifies changes to the parent folder.
*ls projects/new-project - list the contents in file new-project within the directory of projects.
