# What I learned about CSS

What is the purpose of CSS?
    The purpose of CSS is to design the web document according to the users preference. It specifies how web documents are presented to users, how they are styled, laid out, etc.

What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
    -External: allows you to change the entire web page with just one file.
    -Internal: maybe used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
    -Inline: maybe used to apply a unique style for a single element, add style attributes to the relevat element.

Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.
p {
    color: red;
}
